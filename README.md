# Learning React

This is React application made by following tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j942wKiXFu8&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gZD-Tvwfod2gaISzfRiP9d&index=1

This is a simple web-app, where you can add, edit and delete blogs. The idea was to just learn the basics of react. The front page has list of all the blogs and some random
buttons I made just for fun.

The other page is for creating new blogs. There is a form, that asks you the title, body and author of the new blog. That data is then added to the database and it will be
displayed on the front page.
